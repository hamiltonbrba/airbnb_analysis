# Analyzing Seasonal Trends and Their Impact on Airbnb Prices

### Executive Summary
This project examines the impact of seasonal trends on Airbnb listings, focusing on metrics such as price, number of reviews, reviews per month, and availability. Significant seasonal variations were found, with prices peaking in Late Summer and guest activity highest in Late Summer and Early Fall. These insights can help optimize pricing strategies and booking decisions for both hosts and guests.

### Project Description/Outline
We analyzed how seasonal trends affect various Airbnb metrics, such as price, number of reviews, reviews per month, and availability. The project identifies patterns and trends that inform hosts and potential guests about optimal times to rent or stay at an Airbnb property.

### Research Questions
1. How do average nightly rental prices vary by season?
2. How do the number of reviews, reviews per month, and availability change with the seasons?
3. What is the correlation between average nightly rental prices and other metrics across different seasons?

### Major Findings and Implications

**2. Price Distribution by Season**

- The faceted histogram allows for a clear comparison of how nightly rental prices are distributed across different seasons. Late Summer shows the highest concentration of listings in the $100 to $200 range, confirming it as a peak season, while Early Spring and Winter show broader distributions with lower price points.

### ANOVA Test Results
**Statistical Analysis**:
- **Price**: F-value = 42.14, P-value = 5.22e-59 (significant).
- **Number of Reviews**: F-value = 22.15, P-value = 5.99e-30 (significant).
- **Reviews per Month**: F-value = 78.04, P-value = 7.71e-111 (significant).
- **Availability**: F-value = 24.05, P-value = 1.07e-32 (significant).

**Conclusion**: All results indicate significant seasonal variations in Airbnb metrics, particularly in pricing and guest activity.

### Recommendations
- **For Hosts**: Adjust pricing and manage availability seasonally; encourage year-round reviews for optimal visibility and revenue.
- **For Guests**: Book during off-peak seasons for better deals and availability; contribute reviews to the community.

### Data Processing and Filtering
To maintain focus on typical Airbnb listings, properties priced above $350 per night were excluded due to significant outliers.

### Limitations
- **Date Issues**: Limited date availability restricted year-round stay analysis.
- **Price Outliers**: The analysis focused on listings priced $350 or below to maintain data relevance.
